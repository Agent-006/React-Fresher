# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# ⭐ Learn what matters

Facebook was facing a problem that they were not able to show the notifications\
and reactions in real time, to show the notifications and reactions they need to \
reload the page, they were facing this problem because they were using php earlier.\
To solve this problem, in 2013 one of the facebook engineer's made a library and this\
library was special, because this was able to show the data in real time, but the working\
of this library was different. This doesn't updates the <b>main DOM</b> tree directly, means if \
there is any change in the page, the DOM tree will <b>not be</b> updated directly. This library\
has it's own DOM tree named as <b>'Virtual DOM'</b>. This virtual DOM tree is an <b>exact copy</b> of \
the real/main DOM tree, but there is a difference between them, that is whenever there is\
a change in the virtual DOM only that part of the page will be changed rather than\
refreshing the whole page.

This is why react became so famous and useful for big applications.
